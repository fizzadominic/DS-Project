        Function, in mathematics, an expression, rule, or law that defines a
        relationship between one variable (the independent variable) and another
        variable (the dependent variable). Functions are ubiquitous in
        mathematics and are essential for formulating physical relationships in
        the sciences. The modern definition of function was first given in 1837
        by the German mathematician Peter Dirichlet: <br /><br />
        If a variable y is so related to a variable x that whenever a numerical
        value is assigned to x, there is a rule according to which a unique
        value of y is determined, then y is said to be a function of the
        independent variable x. <br /><br />
        This relationship is commonly symbolized as y = f(x)—which is said “f of
        x”—and y and x are related such that for every x, there is a unique
        value of y. That is, f(x) can not have more than one value for the same
        x. To use the language of set theory, a function relates an element x to
        an element f(x) in another set. The set of values of x is called the
        domain of the function, and the set of values of f(x) generated by the
        values in the domain is called the range of the function. In addition to
        f(x), other abbreviated symbols such as g(x) and P(x) are often used to
        represent functions of the independent variable x, especially when the
        nature of the function is unknown or unspecified.
